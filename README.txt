Just me screwing around with a STM32F4 Discovery board and ChibiOS. Also,
writing a README file to make GitHub happy.

... Happy now, GitHub?


Ok, anyways:

	ChibiOS/		External submodule for ChibiOS
	Templates/		Files I copy whenever I write code
	00-BasicBlinky/		Make a green LED flash, ooooh yeah.
	01-RotatingBlinky/	Make all of them sexy LEDs flash.
	02-ButtonBlinky/	Same as above with variable speed
	03-EXTIBlinky/		Same as above, using interrupts
